    <h2>Scanning lots of photos is painful</h2>
    <p>Scanning old family photos is time consuming and boring. 
    Scanning software is terrible, like Epson's SmartScan suite and Apple ImageCapture. 
     </p>
     <p> The biggest surprise to me was that scanning multiple photos at once required a preview scan, then confirmation of the photo edges, and an individual scan for each photo. This amounted to about 3 minutes to scan 3 photos, which in my mind is ridiculous.</p>
     
     <h2> Options for scanning lots of photos</h2>
     <p> It's a question of time and money. You can ship all your photos to companies that scan for you. I like to imagine they have a massive scanner and similar software to this. I did the math and it didn't make sense for me.</p>
